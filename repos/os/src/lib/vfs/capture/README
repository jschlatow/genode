This VFS plugin offers access to Genode's 'Capture' session.

In its current state, it merely provides a single file named
"capture". Reading from this file delivers the pixel data with
4 bytes per pixel, which is mainly useful to receive images from a webcam.

By default, the plugin takes the screen size as reported by the capture session.
If the reported size is invalid, the capture size is taken from the 'width' and
'height' attributes.
