The VFS ctf plugin uses Genode's trace session to create CTF
(common trace format) traces of component interactions. The plugin provides
a file system that can be mounted at an arbitray location within a VFS and is
used for controlling the plugin. For this purpose, the plugin offers two
writeable files:

:'enable': Starts or stops tracing when writing "true" or "false" into
           the file.

:'config': Sets the configuration (XML) used by the plugin (see below). The
           config is read and applied when the plugin is enabled.

In order to mount the file system configure the <vfs> of your component as
follow:

! <vfs>
!   <ram/>
!   <ctf/>
! </vfs>

Since the plugin stores the trace files in the VFS, the latter must also load
a plugin that provides a writable file system (e.g. ram or fs).
The config file must contain a valid XML with a '<config>' node, e.g.:

! <config period_ms="5000" target_root="/">
!    <policy label_suffix="dynamic_rom" policy="ctf_rpc_name"/>
! </config>

The mandatory arguments 'period_ms' and 'target_root' specify the trace-buffer
sampling period in milliseconds and the root path where the output files shall
be placed in the VFS respectively.
The '<config>' node can contain an arbitray number of '<policy>' nodes by which
the plugin determines what components and threads are traced.
The specified 'label_suffix', 'label_prefix' and/or 'label' attributes are
matched against the component labels. By default, all threads of the matching
component(s) will be traced. The mandatory 'policy' attribute specifies the name
of the trace policy to be applied to the matching threads.

Furthermore, the '<policy>' nodes may take the following optional attributes:

:'thread': Restricts the tracing to a certain thread of the matching component(s).

:'buffer': Sets the size of the trace buffer (default: '64K').
